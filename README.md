# Pixi v5 examples guidelines: #

This is the repository for examples using version 5 of PixiJS.

The iframe that displays the examples is **800 * 600**, consequently please avoid creating a renderer that is larger than these dimensions.

## How to run the project ##

This micro-site is built using HTML and jQuery and can be run on your local server without additional requirements.

If you change the site code within `src/js/pixi-examples.js` or any styling within `src/less` you will need to rebuild the project.
After installing dependencies via `npm i`, you can perform a one off projection build via `npm run build`, or start a watch process for development via `npm run watch`.

## Project structure ##

All the examples are stored in the `examples/js` folder and loaded via the ` examples/manifest.json` file.

All the assets are stored in `examples/assets`.

Every sub-folder in the examples folder corresponds to a sub-menu in the website's sidebar.

## How to create an example ##

You can use the basic example as a template, it is located in [```examples/js/demos-basic/container.js```](examples/js/demos-basic/container.js).
All you need to do is copy and paste this file to where you think your example belongs within the `examples/js` folder structure, and change the contents to make a new example. You will then also need to update the `examples/manifest.json` to allow the menu to point to your new example.
